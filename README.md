##PolymerDependencies

`bower.json` files with Polymer Element Dependencies. eg Paper, Gold, Iron, etc.
File names are self-explanatory.

##Why?

The Polymer Project at https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse does not give you a 'download' option when collecting more than 19(?) elements and you have to install components individually.

Knock yourself out!! The final `bower.json` file contains all the elements in one single looong list. 

`Cut-Chop-Change` as you wish.

Consider this a 'kitchen sink' of sorts.

Obviously you could us all of these in a simple project...

##Usage

Download relevant file and rename to `bower.json`

Place file in root directory of your project

`cd my-polymer-project`

`bower install`

Done.

Don't forget to `<link import>` the relevant elements into your app, otherwise, what's the point?

Have Fun.
