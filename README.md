PolymerDependencies

`bower.json` files with Polymer Element Dependencies. eg Paper, Gold, Iron, etc.
File names are self-explanatory.

The Polymer Project at https://elements.polymer-project.org/browse
does not give you a 'download' option when collecting more than 19(?) elements.

Knock yourself out!!
the final `bower.json` file contains all the elements.
Consider this a 'kitchen sink' of sorts.
Obviously you could us all of these in a simple project...

##Usage

Download relevant file and rename to `bower.json`

Place file in root directory of your project

`cd my-polymer-project`

`bower install`

Done.

Don't forget to `<link import>` the relevant elements into your app, otherwise, what's the point?

Have Fun.
